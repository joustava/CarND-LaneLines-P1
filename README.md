**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

This work has been created with the help of the Docker image and setup described in the [Configure and Manage Your Environment with Docker](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/doc/configure_via_docker.md) document. When installed, running `make run` from the repo root directory will start the Docker container and show the results at the url found from the cli output. Please read the original [assignment instructions](./ASSIGNMENT.md) for more context.
